Hello, I am a cybersecurity enthusiast who has completed my bachelor’s degree and has been pursuing my passion for the past three years. I have gained valuable experience in web app security testing through an internship at Famsham, a leading company in the field. I have also been involved in bug bounty hunting and developing my own methodology for finding and reporting vulnerabilities. I have successfully discovered bugs in organizations like Huawei, Khan Academy, and Sephora, and earned recognition and rewards for my work. Currently, I am doing my master’s degree and looking for a challenging and rewarding core security job that will allow me to leverage my skills and grow in the community. I am eager to learn new things and contribute to the security of the digital world.
